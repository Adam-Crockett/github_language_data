This project was created to see a rolling year report of repositories created on GitHub. Several of the most popular languages are displayed.

What was learned:
- Stronger skill on updated React components and class use.
- Use of Typescript in react and module interactions with Typescript.
- Using graphql API data retrieval instead of REST API.

Side note on what the data has shown:
    Each language follows a similar pattern of having more repositories created in the fall/winter with a drop in the spring/summer.
    The recent events of the global pandamic have created an extended increase in repository creation across all languages.
    Languges observed for this project: Java, Python, C++, Javascript
    Java and Python have very similar numbers across the whole year. 
    C++ is consistently below the the other languages.
    Javascript was far higher then the other viewed languages.
